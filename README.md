# Modifiers Project

### Objective
In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use various modifiers in Java.

### Problem

Write a Java program that demonstrates the usage of access and non-access modifiers.

### Implementation

- Define a `Student` class with:
    - A **private** variable`name`
    - A **public** setter and getter methods for the `name` variable
    - A **protected** variable `age`
    - A **final** variable `SCHOOL_NAME` initialized to " Tuwaiq Academy"
    - A **static** variable `studentCount` to track how many `Student` objects have been created
    - A **public** method `displayInfo` to display a student's info, including name, age, and school

- In `main` method:
    - Create two `Student` objects
    - Set their names and ages
    - Call `displayInfo()` for each student to print their details
    - Print the total number of students using the `studentCount` variable


```java
public class Student {

    /* add your code here */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    
    }

}
```
